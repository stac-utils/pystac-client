        World Climate Research Programme's [6th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project
        (CMIP6)](https://www.wcrp-climate.org/wgcm-cmip/wgcm-cmip6) represents an
        enormous advance in the quality, detail, and scope of climate modeling.\\n\\nThe
        [Global Downscaled Projections for Climate Impacts Research](https://github.com/ClimateImpactLab/downscaleCMIP6)
        dataset makes this modeling more applicable to understanding the impacts of
        changes in the climate on humans and society with two key developments: trend-preserving
        bias correction and downscaling. In this dataset, the [Climate Impact Lab](https://impactlab.org)
        provides global, daily minimum and maximum air temperature at the surface
        (`tasmin` and `tasmax`) and daily cumulative surface precipitation (`pr`)
        corresponding to the CMIP6 historical, ssp1-2.6, ssp2-4.5, ssp3-7.0, and ssp5-8.5
        scenarios for 25 global climate models on a 1/4-degree regular global grid.\\n\\n##
        Accessing the data\\n\\nGDPCIR data can be accessed on the Microsoft Planetary
        Computer. The dataset is made of of three collections, distinguished by data
        license:\\n* [Public domain (CC0-1.0) collection](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/cil-gdpcir-cc0)\\n*
        [Attribution (CC BY 4.0) collection](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/cil-gdpcir-cc-by)\\n\\nEach
        modeling center with bias corrected and downscaled data in this collection
        falls into one of these license categories - see the [table below](/dataset/cil-gdpcir-cc-by#available-institutions-models-and-scenarios-by-license-collection)
        to see which model is in each collection, and see the section below on [Citing,
        Licensing, and using data produced by this project](/dataset/cil-gdpcir-cc-by#citing-licensing-and-using-data-produced-by-this-project)
        for citations and additional information about each license.\\n\\n## Data
        format & contents\\n\\nThe data is stored as partitioned zarr stores (see
        [https://zarr.readthedocs.io](https://zarr.readthedocs.io)), each of which
        includes thousands of data and metadata files covering the full time span
        of the experiment. Historical zarr stores contain just over 50 GB, while SSP
        zarr stores contain nearly 70GB. Each store is stored as a 32-bit float, with
        dimensions time (daily datetime), lat (float latitude), and lon (float longitude).
        The data is chunked at each interval of 365 days and 90 degree interval of
        latitude and longitude. Therefore, each chunk is `(365, 360, 360)`, with each
        chunk occupying approximately 180MB in memory.\\n\\nHistorical data is daily,
        excluding leap days, from Jan 1, 1950 to Dec 31, 2014; SSP data is daily,
        excluding leap days, from Jan 1, 2015 to either Dec 31, 2099 or Dec 31, 2100,
        depending on data availability in the source GCM.\\n\\nThe spatial domain
        covers all 0.25-degree grid cells, indexed by the grid center, with grid edges
        on the quarter-degree, using a -180 to 180 longitude convention. Thus, the
        \u201Clon\u201D coordinate extends from -179.875 to 179.875, and the \u201Clat\u201D
        coordinate extends from -89.875 to 89.875, with intermediate values at each
        0.25-degree increment between (e.g. -179.875, -179.625, -179.375, etc).\\n\\n##

        precipitation data was available. Therefore, we provide `tasmin` and `tamax`
        for this model and experiment, but not `pr`. All other model/experiment combinations
        in the above table include all three variables.\\n\\n[^2]: The institution
        which ran MPI-ESM1-2-HR\u2019s historical (CMIP) simulations is `MPI-M`, while
        the future (ScenarioMIP) simulations were run by `DKRZ`. Therefore, the institution
        component of `MPI-ESM1-2-HR` filepaths differ between `historical` and `SSP`
        scenarios.\\n\\n[^3]: This dataset was previously licensed as [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/),

        in March, 2023. \\n\\n## Project methods\\n\\nThis project makes use of statistical
        bias correction and downscaling algorithms, which are specifically designed
        to accurately represent changes in the extremes. For this reason, we selected
        Quantile Delta Mapping (QDM), following the method introduced by [Cannon et
        al. (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-14-00754.1), which preserves quantile-specific
        trends from the GCM while fitting the full distribution for a given day-of-year
        to a reference dataset (ERA5).\\n\\nWe then introduce a similar method tailored
        to increase spatial resolution while preserving extreme behavior, Quantile-Preserving
        Localized-Analog Downscaling (QPLAD).\\n\\nTogether, these methods provide
        a robust means to handle both the central and tail behavior seen in climate
        model output, while aligning the full distribution to a state-of-the-art reanalysis
        dataset and providing the spatial granularity needed to study surface impacts.\\n\\nFor
        further documentation, see [Global downscaled projections for climate impacts

        work is the result of many years worth of work by members of the [Climate
        Impact Lab](https://impactlab.org), but would not have been possible without
        many contributions from across the wider scientific and computing communities.\\n\\nSpecifically,
        we would like to acknowledge the World Climate Research Programme's Working
        Group on Coupled Modeling, which is responsible for CMIP, and we would like
        to thank the climate modeling groups for producing and making their model
        output available. We would particularly like to thank the modeling institutions
        whose results are included as an input to this repository (listed above) for
        their contributions to the CMIP6 project and for responding to and granting
        our requests for license waivers.\\n\\nWe would also like to thank Lamont-Doherty
        Earth Observatory, the [Pangeo Consortium](https://github.com/pangeo-data)
        (and especially the [ESGF Cloud Data Working Group](https://pangeo-data.github.io/pangeo-cmip6-cloud/#))
        and Google Cloud and the Google Public Datasets program for making the [CMIP6
        Google Cloud collection](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/noaa-public/cmip6)
        possible. In particular we're extremely grateful to [Ryan Abernathey](https://github.com/rabernat),
        [Naomi Henderson](https://github.com/naomi-henderson), [Charles Blackmon-Luca](https://github.com/charlesbluca),
        [Aparna Radhakrishnan](https://github.com/aradhakrishnanGFDL), [Julius Busecke](https://github.com/jbusecke),
        and [Charles Stern](https://github.com/cisaacstern) for the huge amount of
        work they've done to translate the ESGF CMIP6 netCDF archives into consistently-formattted,
        analysis-ready zarr stores on Google Cloud.\\n\\nWe're also grateful to the
        [xclim developers](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/graphs/contributors)
        ([DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.2795043](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2795043)), in
        particular [Pascal Bourgault](https://github.com/aulemahal), [David Huard](https://github.com/huard),
        and [Travis Logan](https://github.com/tlogan2000), for implementing the QDM
        bias correction method in the xclim python package, supporting our QPLAD implementation
        into the package, and ongoing support in integrating dask into downscaling
        workflows. For method advice and useful conversations, we would like to thank
        Keith Dixon, Dennis Adams-Smith, and [Joe Hamman](https://github.com/jhamman).\\n\\n##

        World Climate Research Programme's [6th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project
        (CMIP6)](https://www.wcrp-climate.org/wgcm-cmip/wgcm-cmip6) represents an
        enormous advance in the quality, detail, and scope of climate modeling.\\n\\nThe
        [Global Downscaled Projections for Climate Impacts Research](https://github.com/ClimateImpactLab/downscaleCMIP6)
        dataset makes this modeling more applicable to understanding the impacts of
        changes in the climate on humans and society with two key developments: trend-preserving
        bias correction and downscaling. In this dataset, the [Climate Impact Lab](https://impactlab.org)
        provides global, daily minimum and maximum air temperature at the surface
        (`tasmin` and `tasmax`) and daily cumulative surface precipitation (`pr`)
        corresponding to the CMIP6 historical, ssp1-2.6, ssp2-4.5, ssp3-7.0, and ssp5-8.5
        scenarios for 25 global climate models on a 1/4-degree regular global grid.\\n\\n##
        Accessing the data\\n\\nGDPCIR data can be accessed on the Microsoft Planetary
        Computer. The dataset is made of of three collections, distinguished by data
        license:\\n* [Public domain (CC0-1.0) collection](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/cil-gdpcir-cc0)\\n*
        [Attribution (CC BY 4.0) collection](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/cil-gdpcir-cc-by)\\n\\nEach
        modeling center with bias corrected and downscaled data in this collection
        falls into one of these license categories - see the [table below](/dataset/cil-gdpcir-cc-by#available-institutions-models-and-scenarios-by-license-collection)
        to see which model is in each collection, and see the section below on [Citing,
        Licensing, and using data produced by this project](/dataset/cil-gdpcir-cc-by#citing-licensing-and-using-data-produced-by-this-project)
        for citations and additional information about each license.\\n\\n## Data
        format & contents\\n\\nThe data is stored as partitioned zarr stores (see
        [https://zarr.readthedocs.io](https://zarr.readthedocs.io)), each of which
        includes thousands of data and metadata files covering the full time span
        of the experiment. Historical zarr stores contain just over 50 GB, while SSP
        zarr stores contain nearly 70GB. Each store is stored as a 32-bit float, with
        dimensions time (daily datetime), lat (float latitude), and lon (float longitude).
        The data is chunked at each interval of 365 days and 90 degree interval of
        latitude and longitude. Therefore, each chunk is `(365, 360, 360)`, with each
        chunk occupying approximately 180MB in memory.\\n\\nHistorical data is daily,
        excluding leap days, from Jan 1, 1950 to Dec 31, 2014; SSP data is daily,
        excluding leap days, from Jan 1, 2015 to either Dec 31, 2099 or Dec 31, 2100,
        depending on data availability in the source GCM.\\n\\nThe spatial domain
        covers all 0.25-degree grid cells, indexed by the grid center, with grid edges
        on the quarter-degree, using a -180 to 180 longitude convention. Thus, the
        \u201Clon\u201D coordinate extends from -179.875 to 179.875, and the \u201Clat\u201D
        coordinate extends from -89.875 to 89.875, with intermediate values at each
        0.25-degree increment between (e.g. -179.875, -179.625, -179.375, etc).\\n\\n##

        precipitation data was available. Therefore, we provide `tasmin` and `tamax`
        for this model and experiment, but not `pr`. All other model/experiment combinations
        in the above table include all three variables.\\n\\n[^2]: The institution
        which ran MPI-ESM1-2-HR\u2019s historical (CMIP) simulations is `MPI-M`, while
        the future (ScenarioMIP) simulations were run by `DKRZ`. Therefore, the institution
        component of `MPI-ESM1-2-HR` filepaths differ between `historical` and `SSP`
        scenarios.\\n\\n[^3]: This dataset was previously licensed as [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/),

        bias correction and downscaling algorithms, which are specifically designed
        to accurately represent changes in the extremes. For this reason, we selected
        Quantile Delta Mapping (QDM), following the method introduced by [Cannon et
        al. (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-14-00754.1), which preserves quantile-specific
        trends from the GCM while fitting the full distribution for a given day-of-year
        to a reference dataset (ERA5).\\n\\nWe then introduce a similar method tailored
        to increase spatial resolution while preserving extreme behavior, Quantile-Preserving
        Localized-Analog Downscaling (QPLAD).\\n\\nTogether, these methods provide
        a robust means to handle both the central and tail behavior seen in climate
        model output, while aligning the full distribution to a state-of-the-art reanalysis
        dataset and providing the spatial granularity needed to study surface impacts.\\n\\nFor
        further documentation, see [Global downscaled projections for climate impacts

        work is the result of many years worth of work by members of the [Climate
        Impact Lab](https://impactlab.org), but would not have been possible without
        many contributions from across the wider scientific and computing communities.\\n\\nSpecifically,
        we would like to acknowledge the World Climate Research Programme's Working
        Group on Coupled Modeling, which is responsible for CMIP, and we would like
        to thank the climate modeling groups for producing and making their model
        output available. We would particularly like to thank the modeling institutions
        whose results are included as an input to this repository (listed above) for
        their contributions to the CMIP6 project and for responding to and granting
        our requests for license waivers.\\n\\nWe would also like to thank Lamont-Doherty
        Earth Observatory, the [Pangeo Consortium](https://github.com/pangeo-data)
        (and especially the [ESGF Cloud Data Working Group](https://pangeo-data.github.io/pangeo-cmip6-cloud/#))
        and Google Cloud and the Google Public Datasets program for making the [CMIP6
        Google Cloud collection](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/noaa-public/cmip6)
        possible. In particular we're extremely grateful to [Ryan Abernathey](https://github.com/rabernat),
        [Naomi Henderson](https://github.com/naomi-henderson), [Charles Blackmon-Luca](https://github.com/charlesbluca),
        [Aparna Radhakrishnan](https://github.com/aradhakrishnanGFDL), [Julius Busecke](https://github.com/jbusecke),
        and [Charles Stern](https://github.com/cisaacstern) for the huge amount of
        work they've done to translate the ESGF CMIP6 netCDF archives into consistently-formattted,
        analysis-ready zarr stores on Google Cloud.\\n\\nWe're also grateful to the
        [xclim developers](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/graphs/contributors)
        ([DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.2795043](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2795043)), in
        particular [Pascal Bourgault](https://github.com/aulemahal), [David Huard](https://github.com/huard),
        and [Travis Logan](https://github.com/tlogan2000), for implementing the QDM
        bias correction method in the xclim python package, supporting our QPLAD implementation
        into the package, and ongoing support in integrating dask into downscaling
        workflows. For method advice and useful conversations, we would like to thank
        Keith Dixon, Dennis Adams-Smith, and [Joe Hamman](https://github.com/jhamman).\\n\\n##

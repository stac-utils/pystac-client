        is a pair of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging satellites launched in
        2014 and 2016 by the European Space Agency (ESA). Their 6 day revisit cycle
        and ability to observe through clouds makes this dataset perfect for sea and
        land monitoring, emergency response due to environmental disasters, and economic
        applications. This dataset represents the global Sentinel-1 GRD archive, from
        beginning to the present, converted to cloud-optimized GeoTIFF format.","item_assets":{"hh":{"type":"image/tiff;
